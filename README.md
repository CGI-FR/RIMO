# rimo
## Description
Rimo contains tools that helps creating a *masking.yaml* for [PIMO](https://github.com/CGI-FR/PIMO).
It works as a 6 steps process :
![rimo steps](.github/img/rimo_steps.png "rimo steps")
1. `gather` : orchestrate LINO to extract table of the database into a *.jsonl* file
2. `analyse` : extract meaningful information on database from *.jsonl*
3. `export` : dump data into an *Excel* file which serves as a configuration means 
4. `import` : load, store and verify inputted data of the *Excel* file into a *.yaml* file
5. `build` : create a *pimo_masking.yaml* from *.yaml*
6. `script` : build a bash script to execute pipeline for PIMO

<!-- ## Installation
`rimo` command line work in relative project's directory, like `git` or `docker` -->

## Usage

### `rimo analyser`

```console
// to be defined 
```
- `input` : path to a directory or file containing to *jsonl* files
- `output` : optional path to output. If none, same name and directory as input. If directory, same name as input.

**input.jsonl** is a JSON single line that contains a pair of (column_name, value) for every row of the database table

**output.yaml** contain various metrics on table's columns and a small default configuration for PIMO. An example can be found in *src/unit_test/testcase_output.yaml*.

### `rimo exporter`

```console
// to be defined
```
- `input` : path to a *yaml* file
- `output` : optional path to output. If none, same name and directory as input. If directory, same name as input.

**input.yaml** contains information on database generated by `analyser`

**output.xlsx** is an Excel file where input is dumped.
